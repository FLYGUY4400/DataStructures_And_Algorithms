#Algorithm Analysis

#Section 3.2

"""
The seven functions used in this book

1. The constant function f(n) = 3

2. The Logarithm Function
f(n) = log_b(n) for some constant b>1

3. The Linear Function

4. N-Log-N Function

5. Quadratic

6. Cubic Function

7. Polynomials

"""

#Section 3.2 Asymptotic Analysis
#We want to determine the runtime based on the component that grows the fastest

#Section 3.3 The "Big-Oh" Notation
""" 
f(n) \in O(g(n)) 
This is often used to characterize running times and space bounds 
We can ignore constant factors and lower-order terms
